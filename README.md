- 👋 Hi, I’m @chimken0
- 👀 I’m interested in reading books psychology and philosophy, art, guns and military stuff, and also programming, calisthenics, and science based subjects (math, physics, chemistry)
- 🌱 I’m want to learn python, gdscript(in progress), GMOD lua, and the trio of webdevelopment. (also 3d modelling if i got into it too much)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects to enhance my learning, and manifest pure knowledge and experience from other developers
- 📫 How to reach me:
- 💬 discord: ch1mken0
- 📧 email adress: official.chimmken@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: default male pronouns, aka he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: i am sleep deprived at times, also depressed, i am more interested in philosophy, and psychology than programming, a bit inclined to it, but programming sure is fun at times! also i am also a calisthenics guy, you can maybe find me on instagram.
- 🔥 About me (concisely):
-    18 year old muslim guy, who used to be a former amatuer footballer. i am onto programming! but too dumb to process the complex stuff the coding world has to offer :/
-    i am mainly known as ch1mken0 or chimken(the chicken in the drawing) but my OC(the human) is called SH4DE or shade (whos literally me identically cuz am not that creative), i do art, probably gonna do commissions soon too, i own a server/community lol thats it tbh.
